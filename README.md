# Overview

The Page Layout plugin for Movable Type provides the ability for
authors to select which template will be used to publish an entry
or page. This feature could be used for example to control which
pages on a web site contain advertising or not. 

# How it Works

When a blog contains only one entry or only one page archive 
template then this plugin is simply invisible. However, once you
add a second page or entry template, your edit screen is given
a new field which you can modify the value of. This field is a
simple pull down menu containing all of the templates available
to use when publishing that entry or page.

# Warnings, Caveats and Known Issues

* Changing a template set can result in all of your selected
  layouts associated with entries and pages to be erased. There
  is no way to recover.
